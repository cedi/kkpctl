# Command Tree

`kkpctl` uses a cli syntax, similar to `kubectl`, consiting of a _verb_ and _nouns_.

In the following tree, you can see how the commands are structured. The first command is always the verb, while the second is always a noun.

The verbs are `add`, `delete`, `describe`, `edit`, and `get`.
The nouns are `cluster`, `machinedeployment`, and `project`. You can use them together with all verbs.
Some verbs do more advanced operations - like `edit`. This makes it necessary to specify a _adjective_ - like `upgrade`. This may seem confusing, but think of it as "What do I need to do? -> Edit. What do I want to edit? -> The Cluster. What do I want to do with the cluster? -> upgrading it."


There are special commands the top level which are not verbs. These are `completion`, `config`, and `ctx`.
They are not related to any objects inside KKP, this is why they are not accessible via the regular verbs.
